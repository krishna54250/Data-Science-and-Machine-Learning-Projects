# 💰 Cryptocurrency Analysis & Price Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts cryptocurrency price trends using machine learning regression models.
It focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling to understand market behavior and forecast future values.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile, making it difficult for investors and analysts to predict price movements accurately.
This project aims to solve that problem by using **machine learning regression models** to analyze historical crypto data and **forecast future prices**, enabling data-driven insights and better decision-making.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Performed **data preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on cryptocurrency datasets.
- Implemented multiple **regression models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for price prediction.
- Evaluated models using **R² score**, **MSE**, and **MAE** to measure accuracy and generalization.
- Visualized data trends, correlations, and residuals using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Integrated **Plotly** for dynamic and interactive visualizations of price movements.
